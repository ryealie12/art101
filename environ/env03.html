  <h1>｡･:☆ *:･ﾟ☆ Spiders & Dolls ｡･:☆ ☆ *･ﾟ★</h1>

  <p>In the very back of a closet was an old dusty dollhouse. 
  It was originally owned by a girl named Sam Beth who had long
  forgotten it. Spiderwebs grew across the tiny wooden bed and mold
  crept across the floor. The doll family still lived happily though, 
  tucked away in their own world, safe from humans. The dolls have now 
  become good friends with the spiders and live a happy communal
  lifestyle. Originally stuck with the same diet of plastic salad 
  and soup, the Dolls have now branched out from their vegetarian 
  lifestyle to enjoy the occasional spider-caught fly. Additionally,
  the spiders now recline outside of their webs and enjoy a neatly 
  made, grandma-crafted doll bed.</p>
