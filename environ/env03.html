    <h1>｡･:☆ *:･ﾟ☆ Spiders & Dolls ｡･:☆ ☆ *･ﾟ★</h1>
        <p>In the very back of a closet was an old dusty dollhouse. 
        It was orginally owned by a girl named Sam Beth who had long
        forgoten it. Spiderwebs grew across the tiny wooden bed and mold
        crept across the floor. The doll family still lived happily though, 
        tucked away in thier own world, safe from humans. The dolls have now 
        become good friends with the spiders, and live a happy communal
        lifestyle. Originally stuck with the same diet of plastic salad 
        and soup the Dolls have now branched out from their vegitarian 
        lifestle to no enjoy the occasional spider caught fly. Additionally,
        the spiders now recline outside of their webs and enjoy a neatly 
        made, grandma crafted doll bed.</p>
