<h1>｡･:*:･ﾟ★,｡･:*:･ﾟ☆ Spiders & Dolls ｡･:*:･ﾟ★,｡･:*:･ﾟ☆</h1>
    <p>In the very back of a closet was an old dusty dollhouse. 
    It was orginally owned by a current college student who had long
    forgoten it. Spiderwebs grew across the tiny wooden bed and mold
    crept across the floor. The doll family still lived happily though, 
    tucked away in thier own world, safe from humans. The dolls have now 
    become good friends with the spiders, and live a happy communal
    lifestyle. Originally stuck with the same diet of plastic salad 
    and soup the Dolls have now branched out from their vegitarian 
    lifestle to no enjoy the occasional spider caught fly. Additionally,
    the spiders now recline outside of their webs and enjoy a neatly 
    made, grandma crafted doll bed.</p>
