<div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
  <p>Nice Block 1. When I run on a fall morning, it feels like the world 
    is just waking up with me. The air is cool enough to sting a little at first, 
    but after a few strides, it turns refreshing — almost cleansing. I love 
    the way my breath hangs in little clouds as I move, and how the leaves 
    scatter across the path with every step. There’s this quiet stillness all 
    around, broken only by the sound of my shoes hitting the pavement and the 
    rustle of trees overhead. The sunrise usually peeks through the orange and 
    ed leaves, and for a moment, everything feels calm and perfectly in rhythm — my 
    heartbeat, my pace, the world itself. It’s my favorite way to start the day.  </p>

    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
  <p> Nice Block 1. The orange leaves are what make fall runs feel almost magical. They glow in 
    the early light, scattered like fire across the ground, crunching softly beneath my shoes 
    with every step. Sometimes a gust of wind sends them swirling around me, and it feels like 
    I’m running through a slow-motion storm of color. The trees lining the path look alive, their 
    branches blazing with orange and gold, and I can’t help but slow down just to take it all 
    in. There’s something comforting about it — the warmth of the colors against the chill in 
    the air, a reminder that change can be beautiful, even fleeting. </p>
