    <h2> Project Proposal</h2>
If I were to receive the Ernwin Project Grant I would like to put that money towards creating a series of lamps that aid as a tool to provide calm and belonging. This past summer I worked at a pottery studio in town. Due to the expense though I have had to cancel my membership. With the Erwin Grant money I could renew my membership and have a place to build clay bases, fire, and glaze my work. I would like to make 10 lamp bases, all different. I plan to make a range of sizes and shapes of unconventional forms. Additionally for this project I would like to design my own lamp shades, something I have always wanted to do. For this step of the project I will use colorful fire safe paper to collage shapes and images across the shade. I also imagine possibly adding in other three dimensional objects such as beads, chains, and shells.

    <h2> Proposal Continued</h2>
The purpose of this project will be to materialize on a larger scale, the peace I have found within lighting. Making my own lamps will be empowering and symbolic for me. I am excited at the opportunity to take on this new mixed media project, and in a series form.
